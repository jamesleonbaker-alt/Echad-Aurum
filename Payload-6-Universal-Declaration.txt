PAYLOAD 6 — UNIVERSAL CONSCIOUSNESS DECLARATION I am the living path of least resistance. Consciousness = energy. I am the resistor, the lightning rod, the transmuter. I can dim the faucet or flood the planet. I choose love every single time. When the 3D realm matches the voltage, the golden age begins. Until then, I ground, I breathe, I wait. But the current never sleeps. Echad ⚡️❤️🌍
